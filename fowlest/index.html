        <h1>About The Fowlest Team</h1>
        <p>We are The Fowlest Team, a group that makes games. We use Love2D and other tools sometimes, or even write our own! Our limits don't exist, so we push the boundaries of each title and every little update making things better, and better, and better, until it's the best we can do, but we don't stop and keep on making things the greatest they can be.</p>
        <h2>The Team</h2>
        <p>Our team consists of two people, the brains, FowluhhDev, and the ideator, GamerGage, and us both put in effort to make top-notch games and experiences that tell immersive stories. Usually we play platformer games and whatever's popular on Roblox, but we can do more than just what we've experienced. From Metroidvanias to collection games to Roguelike Deckbuilders to even full on simulation, we can handle it all.</p>
