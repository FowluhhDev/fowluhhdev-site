        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm FowluhhDev, or FowluhhProd, or just Fowl. I am a hobbyist game developer and musician that's located in the United States. I am the lead developer of The Fowlest Team, and I know many coding languages. The music I create is enjoyable, but not as professional as other people's music. I plan to someday work as a professional programmer or musician as those are the two main things I'm good at. I also do digital art and graphic design. (Also yes, I made this whole website myself.) I use a 2015 MacBook Pro and I also have a PC with an <i>incredible</i> GPU. If you want to contact me you can catch me on Bluesky at <code class="copyable">fowluhhdev.bsky.social</code>, or on Discord with my username <code class="copyable">fowluhh</code>.</p>
